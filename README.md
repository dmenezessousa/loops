Loop the Loop
Setup and Documentation
Work from your existing code base. If it’s not a git repo yet, take a minute to set it up to sync to your account on GitHub.

Requirements
Add validation on one of the user inputs.
Keep asking until an acceptable value is entered.
Show an image related to your page’s topic, repeated within your page.
Prompt the user with a relevant question for a number (e.g.: “How many cats do you want?” or “What star rating would you give, 1-5?”)
Use a loop in your JavaScript code to show the image that many times.
How could you use functions to make your code more readable?
